This software package is intended to be a baseline for developing web-based
applications with Ruby on Rails and other accompanying technologies.
The code was created by Dave Perret (Recursive Design) and slightly modified 
by me to include such features as: 
- Right-to-Left support. 
- Improved locale selection.    
- Replacing CoffeeScript support module: using Barista instead of bistro-car.
- Added support for jQuery-UI.
- Some other modifications I can't remember now.

Thanks Dave!
